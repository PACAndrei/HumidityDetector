# HumidityDetector

## Project Overview
This repository showcases the **Humidity Detector** project developed as part of a university course on CAD for Electronics. The project involved designing and implementing a two-layer PCB, starting from an initial schematic. The system includes a humidity sensor, amplification stages, a bistable RS latch, and a relay-controlled output for automated control of an external load.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Software**: OrCAD Capture CIS 17.2 Lite
- **Design Features**:
  - Two-layer PCB design
  - Manual reset functionality
  - Protection against voltage surges (diode protection circuit)
  - Components exclusively mounted on the top layer

## Features of the Design
- **Humidity Detection**:
  - The system detects humidity using copper electrodes.
  - When a conductive connection forms between electrodes, the circuit triggers the relay.
- **Signal Amplification**:
  - Transistor stages amplify the signal from the humidity sensor.
- **Control Logic**:
  - An RS latch (bistable multivibrator) maintains the state of the output until reset.
- **Protection**:
  - Diode circuitry protects the relay driver transistor from voltage surges.
